# Array

Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access. Each element has a unique index number.

## Operations on Arrays:

- Traversal: Iterating through the elements of an array.
- Insertion: Adding an element to the array at a specific index.
- Deletion: Removing an element from the array at a specific index.
- Searching: Finding an element in the array by its value or index.


## Types of Arrays:

- One-Dimensional Array: A simple array with a single dimension.
- Multidimensional Array: An array with multiple dimension, such as a matrix.


## Applications of Array:

- Storing data in a sequential manner.
- Implementing queues, stacks and other data structures.
- Representing matrices and tables.
