# Array

Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access. Each element has a unique index number.

## Basic terminologies of Array

- Array Index: In an array, elements are identified by their indexes. Array index starts from 0.
- Array Elements: Elements are items stored in an array and can be accessed by their index.
- Array Length: The Length of an array is determined by the number of elements it can contain.

## Types of Arrays:

- On the basis of Size
- On the basis of dimensions

### Basis of Size

- Fixed Size: We cannot alter or update the size of the array.
- Dynamic Size: The memory is mostly dynamic allocated and de-allocated.

### Basis of Dimensions

- One-Dimensional Array (1D): An array where elements are stored one after another as a row.
- Multi-Dimensional Array (2D, 3D etc): An array with more than one dimension.

## Operations on Arrays:

- Traversal: Iterating through the elements of an array. (e.g: Sequential, Reverse).
- Insertion: Adding an element to the array at a specific index.
- Deletion: Removing an element from the array at a specific index.
- Searching: Finding an element in the array by its value or index.

## Applications of Array:

- Storing data in a sequential manner.
- Implementing queues, stacks and other data structures.
- Representing matrices and tables.
- Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees
