# String

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. <b>Strings</b> are commonly used for storing and manipulating textual data in computer program.
They can be manipulated using various operations like concatenation, substring extraction and comparison.


## What is a String?

String is considered a data type in general and is typically represented as arrays of bytes (or words) that store a sequence of characters.
String is defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character '\0'.


## String Data Type:

In most programming languages, strings are treated as a distinct data type. This means that strings have their own set of operations and properties. They can be declared and manipulated using specific string-related functions and methods.

<b>Note:</b> In some languages, strings are implemented as arrays of characters, making them a derived data type.


## String Operations:

Strings support a wide range of operations, including concatenation, substring extraction, length calculation, and more. These operations allow developers to manipulate and process string data efficiently.

Below are fundamental operations commonly performed on strings in programming.

- Concatenation: Combining two strings to create a new string.
- Length calculation: Calculating the length of a string.
- Access: Accessing individual characters in a string by index.
- Substring extraction: Extracting a portion/substring from a string.
- Comparison: Comparing two strings to check for equality or order.
- Search: Finding the position of a specific substring within a string.
- Modification: Changing or replacing characters within a string.


## Applications of String:

- Text Processing: Strings are extensively used for text processing tasks such as searching, manipulating, and analyzing textual data.
- Data Representation: Strings are fundamental for representing and manipulating data in formats like JSON, XML, and CSV.
- Encryption and Hashing: Strings are commonly used in encryption and hashing algorithms to secure sensitive data and ensure data integrity.
- Database Operations: Strings are essential for working with databases, including storing and querying text-based data.
- Web Development: Strings are utilized in web development for constructing URLs, handling form data, processing input from web forms, and generating dynamic content.
