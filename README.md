# Data Structures

It's a way to organize data. After organizing data it becomes easy to process it.

## Types of Data Structures

- Linear: Arranged in sequensial manner: Array, Linked List, Stack and Queue
- Non-Linear: They are not sequensial manner, they're multilevel: Tree and Graph

# Algorithm

- An algorithm is a set of instructions to perform a task or to solve a given problem.


## Analysis of Algorithm

- Analysis of algorithm deals in finding the best algorithm which runs fast and takes in less memory.
    * Time Complexity
    * Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

- Amount of time taken by algorithm to run.
- The input processed by an algorithm helps in determining the time Complexity.

### Space Complexity

- Amount of memory or space taken by algorithm to run.
- The memory required to process the input by an algorithm helps in determining the space complexity.

### Asymptotic Analysis of an Algorithm

- Asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating performance of an algorithm in terms of input size and its increase.
- Using asymptotic analysis we don't measure actual running time of algorithm.
- It helps in determining how time and space taken by algorithm increases with input size.

### Asymptotic Notations

- Asymptotic Notations are the mathematical tools used to describe the running time of an algorithm in terms or input size.
- Example - Performance of car in 1 liter of petrol
 
```markdown
Highway (Min Traffic) - 25 km/litre
City (Max Traffic) - 15 km/litre
City + Highway (average Traffic) - 20 km/litre
```

Asymptotic Notations helps us in determine:
* Best Case
* Average Case
* Worst Case

### Types of Asymptotic Notations
- There are three notations for performing runtime analysis of an algorithm

* Omega () Notation
* Big O (O) Notation
* Theta () Notation
